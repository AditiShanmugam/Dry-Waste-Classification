# Dry Waste Classification
One of the biggest problems faced by Human Beings as a society is the segregation and management of waste. 
According to world bank reports, 4 billion tonnes of waste in produced annually and 9000 tonnes each day. 
50% of the waste generated is organic and can be decomposed. 30% is recyclable and 20% is non recyclable and is disposed landfills.

The current method employed for waste management, is manual segregation of waste which is not only slow and expensive but also elivates the risk of manual labourers contracting harmful diseases.
This calls for automation of waste classification for faster segregation and eliminating human intervention.

The repository contains the code to classify Dry Waste. This is an implementation of transfer learning and the model used is a fine tuned ResNet50 model with weights retained from pretraining on the ImageNet Dataset. 
The Dataset used can be found on Kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification).
