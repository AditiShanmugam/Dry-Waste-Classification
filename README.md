# Dry Waste Classification
One of the biggest problems faced by Human Beings as a society is the segregation and management of waste. 
According to world bank reports, 4 billion tonnes of waste in produced annually and 9000 tonnes each day. 
50% of the waste generated is organic and can be decomposed. 30% is recyclable and 20% is non recyclable and is disposed landfills.

The current method employed for waste management, is manual segregation of waste followed by transportation of the segregated waste to landfills which is then discarded. 
This calls for automation of waste classification for faster segregation.
