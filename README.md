# Dry Waste Classification
One of the biggest problems faced by Human Beings as a society is the segregation and management of waste. 
According to world bank reports, 4 billion tonnes of waste in produced annually and 9000 tonnes each day.

The current method employed for waste management, is manual segregation of waste. Manual Segregation is not only slow and expensive but also elivates the risk of manual labourers contracting various diseases.
This calls for automation of waste classification for faster segregation and eliminating human intervention.

The repository contains the code for the model used to classify Dry Waste.
